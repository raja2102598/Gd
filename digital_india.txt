good evening everyone,the topic is digital india,i'm going to start the discussion with my opinion on the topic digital india
in 2015 our honourable prime minister narendra modi introduced and launched the digital india scheme,
it helped to turn india into modern and digital india.
most of the indian shops are accepting online payments.
you can buy anything from online and make it delivered to your home also you can pay for that in online itself.
